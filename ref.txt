Spring Framework-

Spring Framework open source framework for building enterprise java application

aims to simplify the complex enterprise java application dev

lightweight

spring consists of spring web flow, spring mvc,spring orm

Core features-
IOC-inversion on control container
AOP-aspect oriented programming
DAF-Data access Framework
MVC-Spring MVC Framework

Spring bean-
an object that is managed by the spring framework in a java application

can be configured using java code

bean life cycle is managed by the spring container

Configuration example-

@configuration declares class as "full" configuration class
class must be non-final and public

@bean declares bean config inside config class

method must be non-final and non-private

@Configuration
public classs AppConfig{
    @Bean 
    public PaymentService paymentService(
        AccountRepository accountRepository
    )
    {
        return new PaymentServiceImpl(accountRepository());
    }
}

Spring Component Sample-
Spring Component contains class-level annotation that marks class as a Spring Component(@Component)

Construtor-dependency injection is automatically done using @Autowired by injecting the constructor  parameters

@autowired on Construtor is optional if there is only one constructor

Spring provides component stereotype to classify classes as spring components
->sub-types are available as a refinement for the standard components

@Component as a general component annotation indicating that the class should be initialized,configured and managed by the core container.

@Repository, @Service and @Controller as meta-annotation for @Component that allows to further re-fine components
to name bean  @Bean("ds")

Dependency Injection-
Constructor Injection
Field Injection
Configuration Methods
Setter Methods Injection


Bean Scope-
Spring Provides multiple scopes
Singleton is the default scope of a bean


scopes-
Singleton
prototype
request
session
application
websocket

@Scope("prototype")

Bean Environment-
Environment Abstraction-
Injectable-

Bean Profile-
@Profile("cloud")

@value annotation
@PropertySource
@Value()
